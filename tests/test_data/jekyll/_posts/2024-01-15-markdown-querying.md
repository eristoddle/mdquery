# Universal Markdown Querying with SQL

In the world of knowledge management, we often find ourselves switching between different tools - Obsidian for personal notes, Jekyll for blogging, and Joplin for research. Each system has its own way of organizing and querying content.

## The Problem

Different markdown systems use different conventions:
- **Obsidian**: Wikilinks like `[[Page Name]]` and nested tags `#category/subcategory`
- **Jekyll**: Frontmatter with categories and tags arrays
- **Joplin**: Timestamp-based organization with simple tags

## The Solution

What if we could query all these systems using familiar SQL syntax?

```sql
SELECT title, tags, created_date
FROM files
WHERE tags LIKE '%productivity%'
AND created_date > '2024-01-01'
ORDER BY created_date DESC;
```

## Benefits

1. **Unified Interface**: One query language for all systems
2. **Powerful Analysis**: SQL aggregations and joins
3. **Cross-System Compatibility**: Works with any markdown format

## Implementation

The key is building a universal indexer that can parse different markdown formats and expose them through a common SQL interface.

{% highlight python %}
from mdquery import QueryEngine

engine = QueryEngine()
results = engine.query("SELECT * FROM files WHERE tags LIKE '%development%'")
{% endhighlight %}

## Conclusion

Universal markdown querying opens up new possibilities for content analysis and organization across different systems.
