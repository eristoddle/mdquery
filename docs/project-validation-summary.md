## Issues Identified and Resolved

### Fixed During Validation

**Requirements.txt Issues**
- ❌ **Issue**: Invalid `markdown-extensions>=0.1.0` dependency
- ✅ **Resolution**: Removed problematic dependency, using built-in markdown extensions

**Syntax Errors**
- ❌ **Issue**: Broken lines in `cli.py` and `indexer.py` files  
- ✅ **Resolution**: Fixed malformed function definitions and decorators

**Missing Dependencies**
- ❌ **Issue**: `psutil` module not in requirements.txt
- ✅ **Resolution**: Added `psutil>=5.8.0` to requirements

**Import Issues**
- ❌ **Issue**: Missing `Any` type import in `indexer.py`
- ✅ **Resolution**: Added proper typing imports

### Outstanding Issues

**MCP Server Async Conflict**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: RuntimeError with asyncio when running MCP server in some environments
- 🔧 **Impact**: Server initialization works, but runtime may have issues in certain contexts
- 📋 **Workaround**: Server configuration and tool registration functional; async issue appears environmental

**Database Initialization**
- ⚠️ **Issue**: Some CLI indexing operations fail with "no such table" errors
- 🔧 **Impact**: Basic functionality works, but edge cases need handling
- 📋 **Recommendation**: Use MCP server initialization path which handles database setup properly
