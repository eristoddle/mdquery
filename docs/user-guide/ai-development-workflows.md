## Overview

AI development involves complex, iterative processes that generate vast amounts of documentation, research notes, experiment logs, and collaboration records. mdquery enables you to analyze these development artifacts to:

- **Identify Research Patterns**: Find gaps, duplications, and opportunities in your research
- **Track Project Progress**: Monitor development velocity and identify bottlenecks
- **Optimize Learning**: Analyze what approaches work best and why
- **Improve Team Efficiency**: Understand collaboration patterns and knowledge sharing
- **Make Data-Driven Decisions**: Use historical project data to guide future decisions

This comprehensive guide provides a foundation for using mdquery to analyze and optimize AI development processes. The key is to start with simple queries and gradually build more sophisticated analyses as you understand your note-taking patterns and development workflows better.

Remember that the most valuable insights often come from combining multiple query results and looking for patterns across different aspects of your development process. Use these examples as starting points and adapt them to your specific projects, team structure, and research areas.
